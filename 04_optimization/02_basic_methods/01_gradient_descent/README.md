## 📐 DETAILED MATHEMATICAL THEORY

### 1. Gradient Descent: Complete Convergence Analysis

**Algorithm:**

```
Input: f: ℝⁿ → ℝ, starting point x₀, learning rate α
Output: x* ≈ argmin f

For k = 0, 1, 2, ...:
  1. Compute gradient: g_k = ∇f(x_k)
  2. Update: x_{k+1} = x_k - α·g_k
  3. Check convergence: ||g_k|| < ε

Return x_k

```

### 2. Convergence for Convex + L-Smooth Functions

**Theorem 1: Sublinear Convergence**

```
Assumptions:
  1. f is convex
  2. f is L-smooth: ||∇f(x) - ∇f(y)|| ≤ L||x - y||
  3. Step size: α = 1/L

Then: f(x_k) - f(x*) ≤ (2L||x_0 - x*||²)/k

Convergence rate: O(1/k) iterations

```

**Proof:**

```
Step 1: L-smoothness implies quadratic upper bound
  For any x, y:
    f(y) ≤ f(x) + ∇f(x)ᵀ(y-x) + (L/2)||y-x||²

Step 2: Apply to GD update with α = 1/L
  Let y = x_{k+1} = x_k - (1/L)∇f(x_k)
  
  f(x_{k+1}) ≤ f(x_k) + ∇f(x_k)ᵀ(x_{k+1} - x_k) + (L/2)||x_{k+1} - x_k||²
             = f(x_k) - (1/L)||∇f(x_k)||² + (L/2)·(1/L²)||∇f(x_k)||²
             = f(x_k) - (1/2L)||∇f(x_k)||²

Step 3: Descent lemma
  f(x_{k+1}) ≤ f(x_k) - (1/2L)||∇f(x_k)||²  ... (*)

Step 4: By convexity
  f(x_k) - f(x*) ≤ ∇f(x_k)ᵀ(x_k - x*)  (first-order condition)
                 ≤ ||∇f(x_k)||·||x_k - x*||  (Cauchy-Schwarz)

  Therefore: ||∇f(x_k)||² ≥ (f(x_k) - f(x*))²/||x_k - x*||²

Step 5: Substitute into (*)
  f(x_{k+1}) ≤ f(x_k) - (1/2L)·(f(x_k) - f(x*))²/||x_k - x*||²

Step 6: Track distance to optimum
  ||x_{k+1} - x*||² = ||x_k - (1/L)∇f(x_k) - x*||²
                    = ||x_k - x*||² - (2/L)∇f(x_k)ᵀ(x_k - x*) + (1/L²)||∇f(x_k)||²

  By convexity: ∇f(x_k)ᵀ(x_k - x*) ≥ f(x_k) - f(x*)
  
  Therefore:
  ||x_{k+1} - x*||² ≤ ||x_k - x*||² - (2/L)(f(x_k) - f(x*)) + (1/L²)||∇f(x_k)||²

Step 7: From Step 3, we have ||∇f(x_k)||² ≤ 2L(f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1}))
  
  Substituting:
  ||x_{k+1} - x*||² ≤ ||x_k - x*||² - (2/L)(f(x_k) - f(x*)) + (2/L)(f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1}))
                    = ||x_k - x*||² - (2/L)(f(x_{k+1}) - f(x*))

Step 8: Rearrange
  f(x_{k+1}) - f(x*) ≤ (L/2)(||x_k - x*||² - ||x_{k+1} - x*||²)

Step 9: Sum telescoping series from 0 to k-1
  Σᵢ₌₀^{k-1} (f(x_{i+1}) - f(x*)) ≤ (L/2)||x_0 - x*||²

  Since f(x_i) is decreasing:
  k·(f(x_k) - f(x*)) ≤ Σᵢ₌₀^{k-1} (f(x_{i+1}) - f(x*)) ≤ (L/2)||x_0 - x*||²

  Therefore: f(x_k) - f(x*) ≤ (L||x_0 - x*||²)/(2k) ✓  QED

```

### 3. Strongly Convex Case: Linear Convergence

**Theorem 2: Exponential Convergence**

```
Additional assumption:
  f is μ-strongly convex: f(y) ≥ f(x) + ∇f(x)ᵀ(y-x) + (μ/2)||y-x||²

Then with α = 1/L:
  f(x_k) - f(x*) ≤ (1 - μ/L)^k (f(x_0) - f(x*))

Convergence rate: O((1 - μ/L)^k) = O(ρ^k) where ρ = 1 - μ/L

```

**Key Quantity: Condition Number**

```
κ = L/μ  (condition number)

Convergence rate: ρ = 1 - 1/κ = (κ-1)/κ

Examples:
  κ = 2:   ρ = 0.5    → Half distance each step
  κ = 10:  ρ = 0.9    → 10% improvement per step
  κ = 100: ρ = 0.99   → 1% improvement per step (slow!)
  κ = ∞:   ρ = 1      → No improvement (ill-conditioned)

Number of iterations to reach ε-accuracy:
  k ≥ κ·log(1/ε)

```

**Proof Sketch:**

```
Step 1: Combine descent lemma with strong convexity
  From L-smoothness:
    f(x_{k+1}) ≤ f(x_k) - (1/2L)||∇f(x_k)||²
  
  From strong convexity:
    ||∇f(x_k)||² ≥ 2μ(f(x_k) - f(x*))
  
  Therefore:
    f(x_{k+1}) - f(x*) ≤ f(x_k) - f(x*) - (μ/L)(f(x_k) - f(x*))
                       = (1 - μ/L)(f(x_k) - f(x*))

Step 2: Apply recursively
  f(x_k) - f(x*) ≤ (1 - μ/L)^k (f(x_0) - f(x*)) ✓  QED

```

### 4. Non-Convex Case: Stationary Points

**Theorem 3: First-Order Stationary Point**

```
For non-convex f (L-smooth):

GD with α = 1/L satisfies:
  min_{0≤k≤K-1} ||∇f(x_k)||² ≤ (2L(f(x_0) - f_inf))/K

where f_inf = inf_x f(x)

Interpretation: Find ε-stationary point (||∇f|| ≤ ε) in O(1/ε²) iterations

```

**Proof:**

```
Step 1: From descent lemma (still holds for non-convex!)
  f(x_{k+1}) ≤ f(x_k) - (1/2L)||∇f(x_k)||²

Step 2: Rearrange
  ||∇f(x_k)||² ≤ 2L(f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1}))

Step 3: Sum from k=0 to K-1
  Σₖ₌₀^{K-1} ||∇f(x_k)||² ≤ 2L Σₖ₌₀^{K-1} (f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1}))
                           = 2L(f(x_0) - f(x_K))
                           ≤ 2L(f(x_0) - f_inf)

Step 4: Minimum of LHS terms
  K · min_{k} ||∇f(x_k)||² ≤ Σₖ ||∇f(x_k)||² ≤ 2L(f(x_0) - f_inf)

  Therefore: min_k ||∇f(x_k)||² ≤ (2L(f(x_0) - f_inf))/K ✓  QED

```

**Important Note:**

```
For non-convex functions:
  • GD finds stationary points (∇f = 0)
  • Could be local min, local max, or saddle point!
  • No guarantee of global minimum
  • Neural networks are non-convex, yet GD works well (mystery!)

```

### 5. Learning Rate Selection: Theory vs Practice

**Theoretical Optimal: α = 1/L**

```
Requires knowing L (Lipschitz constant of ∇f)

How to estimate L?
  Method 1: Upper bound from network architecture
    L ≤ Π_l ||W_l||₂  (product of spectral norms)
  
  Method 2: Backtracking line search
    Try α, α/2, α/4, ... until descent condition satisfied
  
  Method 3: Start large, decay over time
    α_k = α_0 / (1 + k·decay_rate)

```

**Practical Schedules:**

```
1. Constant (simplest):
   α_k = α_0
   
   Pros: Simple
   Cons: May oscillate near minimum

2. Step decay:
   α_k = α_0 · γ^⌊k/s⌋
   
   Example: Divide by 10 every 30 epochs
   Used in: ResNet training

3. Exponential decay:
   α_k = α_0 · e^{-λk}
   
   Smooth decay

4. 1/k schedule (theoretical):
   α_k = α_0 / k
   
   Satisfies Robbins-Monro conditions:
   • Σ_k α_k = ∞  (go far enough)
   • Σ_k α_k² < ∞  (noise decreases)

5. Cosine annealing:
   α_k = α_min + (α_max - α_min) · (1 + cos(πk/K))/2
   
   Smooth, popular for transformers

6. Warmup + decay:
   α_k = α_max · min(k/k_warmup, (k/k_warmup)^{-0.5})
   
   Used in: BERT, GPT training

```

### 6. Momentum: Accelerated Gradient Descent

**Standard Momentum (Polyak 1964):**

```
Algorithm:
  v₀ = 0
  For k = 0, 1, 2, ...:
    v_{k+1} = β·v_k + ∇f(x_k)
    x_{k+1} = x_k - α·v_{k+1}

where β ∈ [0,1) is momentum coefficient (typically 0.9)

```

**Intuition:**

```
v_k = exponential moving average of gradients
    = β·v_{k-1} + g_k
    = g_k + β·g_{k-1} + β²·g_{k-2} + ...
    = Σᵢ₌₀^∞ β^i·g_{k-i}

Effect:
  • Accumulates gradients in consistent directions
  • Dampens oscillations in inconsistent directions
  • "Velocity" builds up downhill

```

**Convergence Improvement:**

```
Without momentum:
  k ≥ κ·log(1/ε)  iterations

With momentum (optimal β):
  k ≥ √κ·log(1/ε)  iterations

Speedup: √κ
  κ = 100 → 10× fewer iterations!
  κ = 10000 → 100× fewer iterations!

```

**Nesterov Momentum (Nesterov 1983):**

```
Algorithm:
  v₀ = 0
  For k = 0, 1, 2, ...:
    x_lookahead = x_k - α·β·v_k  (lookahead position)
    v_{k+1} = β·v_k + ∇f(x_lookahead)  (gradient at lookahead!)
    x_{k+1} = x_k - α·v_{k+1}

Key difference: Evaluate gradient at lookahead position

```

**Why Nesterov is Better:**

```
Standard momentum: "Blind momentum"
  1. Apply momentum
  2. Compute gradient
  3. Update

Nesterov: "Look ahead"
  1. Look ahead where momentum takes us
  2. Compute gradient there
  3. Update with corrected direction

Result: Better correction when approaching minimum
Convergence: Same O(√κ) but better constants

```

---

### 7. Line Search Methods

**Backtracking Line Search:**

```
Algorithm:
  Input: x, direction d, α_init, β ∈ (0,1), c ∈ (0,1)
  
  α = α_init
  While f(x + α·d) > f(x) + c·α·∇f(x)ᵀd:  (Armijo condition)
    α = β·α
  
  Return α

Typical values: β = 0.5, c = 0.1

Guarantees: O(log(1/α_final)) backtracking steps

```

**Wolfe Conditions:**

```
Sufficient decrease (Armijo):
  f(x + α·d) ≤ f(x) + c₁·α·∇f(x)ᵀd

Curvature condition:
  ∇f(x + α·d)ᵀd ≥ c₂·∇f(x)ᵀd

Typical: c₁ = 10⁻⁴, c₂ = 0.9

Together ensure:
  • Step not too short (sufficient progress)
  • Step not too long (gradient decreases)

```

---

### 8. Convergence in Practice: Neural Networks

**Why Theory Doesn't Match Practice:**

```
Theory says:
  • Non-convex → only stationary points guaranteed
  • May get stuck in local minima
  • May converge to saddle points

Practice shows:
  • SGD reliably finds good solutions
  • Local minima are often nearly as good as global
  • Saddle points rarely problematic

Explanations:
  1. Over-parameterization: Many paths to good solutions
  2. Random initialization: Different starting points
  3. Stochasticity: Noise helps escape bad regions  
  4. Landscape geometry: High-dim → saddles, not local mins
  5. Implicit regularization: SGD prefers flat minima

```

**Empirical Observations:**

```
1. Loss landscape has many good minima
   Neural nets have high symmetry → many equivalent solutions

2. Width helps optimization
   Wider networks → easier to optimize
   NTK theory: infinite width → convex optimization!

3. Batch size affects generalization
   Small batch: More noise, better generalization
   Large batch: Faster convergence, may overfit
   

4. Learning rate most critical
   Too high: Divergence or oscillation
   Too low: Slow convergence
   Just right: Fast convergence to good solution

```

---

### 9. Common Failure Modes

**1. Exploding Gradients:**

```
Symptom: Loss becomes NaN
Cause: ||∇f|| → ∞
Solution: Gradient clipping
  ∇ → ∇ · min(1, threshold/||∇||)

```

**2. Vanishing Gradients:**

```
Symptom: No learning progress
Cause: ||∇f|| → 0 prematurely
Solution: 
  • Better initialization (He/Xavier)
  • Normalization (BatchNorm/LayerNorm)
  • Skip connections (ResNet)
  • Better activations (ReLU instead of sigmoid)

```

**3. Oscillation:**

```
Symptom: Loss bounces up and down
Cause: Learning rate too large
Solution:
  • Reduce learning rate
  • Add momentum
  • Use adaptive methods (Adam)

```

**4. Plateau:**

```
Symptom: Loss stops decreasing
Cause: Saddle point or flat region
Solution:
  • Add noise (larger batch, dropout)
  • Change learning rate (increase then decrease)
  • Change architecture

```

## 📐 DETAILED MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS

### 1. Convergence Proof (Strongly Convex Case)

**Theorem:** For strongly convex f with L-smooth gradient (L-Lipschitz), gradient descent with step size α ≤ 1/L converges linearly.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Setup**

```
Assumptions:

1. f is μ-strongly convex: f(y) ≥ f(x) + ∇f(x)ᵀ(y-x) + (μ/2)||y-x||²

2. ∇f is L-Lipschitz: ||∇f(x) - ∇f(y)|| ≤ L||x-y||

3. Step size: α = 1/L

```

**Step 2: One-step progress**

```
Let eₖ = f(xₖ) - f(x*) be the error at iteration k

From the update rule:
xₖ₊₁ = xₖ - α∇f(xₖ)

Using L-smoothness:
f(xₖ₊₁) ≤ f(xₖ) + ∇f(xₖ)ᵀ(xₖ₊₁ - xₖ) + (L/2)||xₖ₊₁ - xₖ||²
         = f(xₖ) - α||∇f(xₖ)||² + (Lα²/2)||∇f(xₖ)||²
         = f(xₖ) - (α - Lα²/2)||∇f(xₖ)||²

```

**Step 3: Use strong convexity**

```
From μ-strong convexity:
f(xₖ) - f(x*) ≤ (1/2μ)||∇f(xₖ)||²

Therefore:
||∇f(xₖ)||² ≥ 2μ(f(xₖ) - f(x*)) = 2μeₖ

```

**Step 4: Combine**

```
With α = 1/L:

eₖ₊₁ = f(xₖ₊₁) - f(x*)
     ≤ f(xₖ) - (1/L - 1/(2L)) · 2μeₖ - f(x*)
     = eₖ - (μ/L)eₖ
     = (1 - μ/L)eₖ

```

**Step 5: Iterate**

```
eₖ ≤ (1 - μ/L)ᵏ · e₀

Convergence rate: ρ = 1 - μ/L < 1

Condition number: κ = L/μ
  • Small κ → fast convergence
  • Large κ → slow convergence (ill-conditioned)

```

**Conclusion:** Linear convergence with rate O((1-μ/L)ᵏ) = O(e⁻ᵏ/κ) ∎

### 2. Step Size Selection: Theory

**Theorem (Armijo Rule):** Choose α such that:

```
f(xₖ - α∇f(xₖ)) ≤ f(xₖ) - c·α||∇f(xₖ)||²

where c ∈ (0, 1) (typically c = 0.0001)

```

**Proof of sufficient decrease:**

```
Taylor expansion:
f(xₖ - α∇f(xₖ)) ≈ f(xₖ) - α||∇f(xₖ)||² + O(α²)

For small α, quadratic term is negligible
→ Linear decrease guaranteed

```

**Backtracking line search algorithm:**

```python
def backtracking_line_search(f, grad_f, x, p, alpha=1.0, rho=0.5, c=1e-4):
    """
    Find step size using Armijo condition
    
    Args:
        f: objective function
        grad_f: gradient function
        x: current point
        p: search direction (typically -grad_f(x))
        alpha: initial step size
        rho: shrinkage factor (0 < rho < 1)
        c: Armijo constant (0 < c < 1)
    """
    fx = f(x)
    grad = grad_f(x)
    
    while f(x + alpha * p) > fx + c * alpha * np.dot(grad, p):
        alpha *= rho
    
    return alpha

# Usage
x = current_point
grad = grad_f(x)
alpha = backtracking_line_search(f, grad_f, x, -grad)
x_new = x - alpha * grad

```

### 3. Momentum: Mathematical Intuition

**Standard Gradient Descent:**

```
xₖ₊₁ = xₖ - α∇f(xₖ)

```

**Gradient Descent with Momentum:**

```
vₖ₊₁ = βvₖ + ∇f(xₖ)     (velocity)
xₖ₊₁ = xₖ - αvₖ₊₁        (position)

```

**Why does it work?**

**Step 1: Exponential moving average**

```
Expanding vₖ₊₁:
vₖ₊₁ = ∇f(xₖ) + β∇f(xₖ₋₁) + β²∇f(xₖ₋₂) + ...
     = Σᵢ₌₀^∞ βⁱ∇f(xₖ₋ᵢ)

Interpretation: Weighted average of past gradients
Recent gradients have more weight (β ≈ 0.9)

```

**Step 2: Oscillation damping**

```
Consider f(x, y) = x²/100 + y² (ill-conditioned)

Without momentum:
  Oscillates in y-direction (steep)
  Slow progress in x-direction (flat)

With momentum:
  Averages out y-oscillations
  Accumulates x-direction movement
  → Faster convergence!

```

**Step 3: Mathematical analysis**

```
For quadratic f(x) = (1/2)xᵀQx:

Optimal β = ((√κ - 1)/(√κ + 1))²
where κ = λₘₐₓ/λₘᵢₙ (condition number)

Convergence rate improves from O(κ) to O(√κ)!

```

### 4. Common Research Paper Notation

When reading ML research papers, you'll encounter these gradient descent variants:

| Paper Notation | Meaning | Notes |
|----------------|---------|-------|
| θₜ₊₁ = θₜ - η∇L | Basic GD | η = learning rate |
| θₜ₊₁ = θₜ - ηₜ∇L | Adaptive LR | Learning rate schedule |
| mₜ = β₁mₜ₋₁ + (1-β₁)∇L | Adam momentum | Exponential MA of gradient |
| vₜ = β₂vₜ₋₁ + (1-β₂)(∇L)² | Adam variance | Exponential MA of squared gradient |
| θₜ₊₁ = θₜ - η·mₜ/√vₜ | Adam update | Adaptive per-parameter LR |
| g̃ₜ = ∇L(θₜ; xᵢ) | Mini-batch gradient | Stochastic estimate |
| ||gₜ||₂ ≤ C | Gradient clipping | Prevent exploding gradients |

### 5. Practical Tips for Research Papers

**Reading gradient descent in papers:**

1. **Look for the optimizer choice** (Methods section)
   ```
   Common statements:
   "We use Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-3"
   "SGD with momentum 0.9 and weight decay 1e-4"
   "Learning rate warm-up for 1000 steps, then cosine decay"
   ```

2. **Hyperparameters matter!**
   ```
   ✓ Learning rate: Most critical (often 10x changes work/fail)
   ✓ Batch size: Affects gradient noise and memory
   ✓ Warmup: Prevents initial instability
   ✓ Decay schedule: Improves final performance
   ```

3. **Common paper tricks:**
   ```
   • Layer-wise adaptive LR (LAMB, LARS)
   • Gradient accumulation (simulate large batch)
   • Mixed precision (FP16/BF16) for speed
   • Sharded optimizers (ZeRO) for large models
   ```

    n, d = 100, 2
    X = np.random.randn(n, d)  # Data
    w_true = np.array([2.0, -1.5])  # True weights
    y = X @ w_true + 0.1 * np.random.randn(n)  # Noisy observations
    
    # Analytical gradient: ∇f(w) = Xᵀ(Xw - y)
    def f(w):
        return 0.5 * np.sum((X @ w - y)**2)
    
    def grad_f(w):
        return X.T @ (X @ w - y)
    
    # Gradient descent

    lr = 0.01
    history = {'w': [w.copy()], 'loss': [f(w)], 'grad_norm': [np.linalg.norm(grad_f(w))]}
    
    print("Iteration | Loss      | ||∇f||   | w")
    print("-" * 60)
    
    for t in range(100):
        g = grad_f(w)  # Compute gradient
        w = w - lr * g  # Update
        
        history['w'].append(w.copy())
        history['loss'].append(f(w))
        history['grad_norm'].append(np.linalg.norm(g))
        
        if t % 10 == 0:
            print(f"{t:9d} | {f(w):9.5f} | {np.linalg.norm(g):9.5f} | [{w[0]:.3f}, {w[1]:.3f}]")
    
    print(f"\nTrue weights:   [{w_true[0]:.3f}, {w_true[1]:.3f}]")
    print(f"Found weights:  [{w[0]:.3f}, {w[1]:.3f}]")
    print(f"Error: {np.linalg.norm(w - w_true):.6f}")
    
    return history

# Run example
